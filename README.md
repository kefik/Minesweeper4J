# Minesweeper4J
Minesweepr for Java (using Swing via [Clear2D](http://github.com/kefik/Clear2D)) tailored for casual playing but especially for creating custom Minesweeper agents. Fully playable but truly meant for programmers for the development of Sokoban artificial players.

## FEATURES

1) HumanAgent and ArtificialAgent stubs; ArtificialAgent is using own thread for thinking (does not stuck GUI).

2) "Advice" action that provides an agent with "next safe position" advice; agent performance can thus be random-free, just compare how many advices they required.
-- press "S" when playing to obtain "next advice"

3) You can press "SPACE" to show the whole board

4) Possible to run headless simulations (same result as visualized, only faster).

5) Use "Minesweeper" static methods for quick startups of your code (both for humans and artificial agents).

6) Mavenized (repo and dependency at the end of the page); uses some of my other stuff, but that can be easily cut off if you're considering branching.

7) Tested with Java 1.8, compilable with 1.6 as well; jars in Maven are compiled using Java 1.8.

8) Using pure Swing via [Clear2D](http://github.com/kefik/Clear2D), no other 3rd-party libs = no complexities...
